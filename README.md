# Pdf No Text

Remove text from PDF documents

## Goal

Often PDF documents can have obfuscated or corrupt text. Although the document may render fine in a PDF viewer, 
copying the text might result in a mess of odd or invalid characters. There are decompressors, 
but they do not work 100% of the time. 
It is fairly easy to OCR a document, but this will overlay OCR text alongside existing text 
creating a giant mess. **Pdf no text** removes the copyable element of the text but not visual component from a
PDF document.
